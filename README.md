# stock-picker
The Odin Project Ruby project 3

Problem
Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.

Solution
Iterate over the array twice to compare each element. Not the best solution because the time complexity is exponential
